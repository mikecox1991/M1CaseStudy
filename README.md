# TITLE
Sheet Metal and AI?
## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Machina Labs

* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in 2019

* Who are the founders of the company?
Edward Mehr CEO Co-founder, Babk Raeisinia Co-founder, Head of Tech Partnership

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
They saw there was not a of agility to manufacturing porcess to make cast and dies in the business. There was not the flexibility to make different molds you had to rebuild a whole line. Machina Labs is using robots and AI to make accurate in-process learning to create molds cheaper and faster than anyother company out there.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Funding via Crunchbase Series B US$ 32M
## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The flexibility of change parts in the sheet metal industry, they are using robots and ai to act as "old school blacksmiths". 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
They partnered with the United States Air Force, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, SpaceX. They have a lot of great industry leading companies they offer solutions for.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
They are able to work around the clock, robots running to make mold and dies for their customers, the phyical work is done by the robots, the QA and in-process learning is completed by AI using machine learning models. While humans can focus on engineering and customer out reach.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Manufacturing sheet metal 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The Manufacturing world has been innovative but does not mean companies themselves upgrade quickly. Before manufacturing was a very difficult field using relay logic, meaning you would have a bunch of relays with inputs fromt he field and would fire these relays. This was very costly, now manufacturing uses PLC's (programmable logic controller) and PAC's (programmable automation controllers). PLCs revolutionized and made processes efficient and compact in one cabinet versus changing a whole control cabinet for different processes. PLCs moved the manufacturing business into industry 3.0 everything is hard wire connected and a step into the future, now we have entered Industry 4.0 utilizing a more digital world using ethernet protocols, AWS cloud, OPC UA, and much more IT and computer science technologies. We are now on the edge of AI being introduced which will take us to Industry 5.0, this will be smarter, faster and higher quality products being made in manufacturing. There are products using AI and mainly using this with quality control. 

Machina Labs is using their AI in real time to predict if a piece of material is being pushed to hard and damaging the mold they are printing. In a way this is quality control but it teaches the Machine Learning algorithm whether or not what they did was right and the algorithm will change how their process should be. This is interesting, most manufcturing lines has supervised machine learning 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
From what I understand and google searches I do not think, in the united states someone else is using machina labs process to make sheet metal molds suing AI and robotics.
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Huge impact they are cutting the cost for creating and making tooling, the Air Force chose Machina Labs because they can turn out tooling for cheaper and a lot faster than other traditional companies. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
The metrics they are using is Elon Musk theory how can we make something that has been done a certain way for years, make it faster, make it better, make it cheaper. Ed is a problem solver and willing to get into the problem and make things happen. The company has grown from 2019 to 2024 has quadrupled their empolyee count, in 5 years recieving deal leading up to 32M dollars. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Blowing them out of the water and working with new age companies that are leading industries. Ed has a background from Google, SpaceX and other companies he has been focused and found a way to make something great. Still in beginning stages but if he can make this process faster that will cripple his competitors.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would say Robotic assembly on smaller scales to increase efficiency in other companies, using AI to work with autocad and make other mechanical parts from a completely Robotic level. This would still use the companies core business of sheet metal, but this would make other components at a cheaper cost and possibly partner with other manufacturing companies creating machines and use their model. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
It would be another challenge, curoius engineers want to create solve problems and answer the question "It cant be done". This would solve problem with quality control and making better cheaper parts and bring back the American Manufacturing industry. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This would require loads of tooling, micro precision, and training the AI to be trained different. Every application would be different so every job would be new. Some machine would limit the size, movement, storage for the robots tooling. SO it would be a different solution for every job. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Manufacturing is taking a hit politically and socially, the new generations do not want to sit at a machine wasting their lives making something they do not care about. So high turn over of staff. Also as minimum wage increases in California, if you can make 20 an hour at McDonalds why work on a manufacturing floor for less? These are major factors for why high turn over and lack of skill, what is not going away are the Engineering teams but they are bogged down by projects and breakdowns. 

This would be a great way to have quality control checks, good products happy customers better sales. This can replace operators that are causing high turn over and using their pay to fund the machines, and give raises to your more senior operators. Something more technical will attract more Engineers willing to work there. 

Manufacturing is a hard, dirty, field that most people can not handle. Manufacturing companies are fighting higher wages, and younger generations. Higher turn over and usually the bigger companies win. This hurts the little guy, having more technical machines working with their applications and truly automating philosophies applied, "elminate redemdial tasks humans do not want to do".
