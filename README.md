# Sheet Metal and AI?

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Machina Labs.

* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in 2019.

* Who are the founders of the company?
Edward Mehr CEO Co-founder; Babk Raeisinia Co-founder, Head of Tech Partnership

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
They saw there was not agility to the manufacturing process to make cast and dies in the business. Using the knowledge of how a Blacksmith would work, tools to be used. How a hammer is applicable to multiple pieces. The same thought went into MachinaLabs make sheet metal creation flexible and universal.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Funding via Crunchbase Series B US$ 32M

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The flexibility of change parts in the sheet metal industry, they are using robots and AI to act as "old school blacksmiths". One robot, multiple cast, molds, and dies can be made, versus one line and having to do change overs.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
They partnered with the United States Air Force, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, SpaceX. They have a lot of great industry leading companies they offer solutions for.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
They are able to work around the clock, robots running to make mold and dies for their customers, the phyical work is done by the robots, the QA and in-process learning is completed by AI using machine learning models. While humans can focus on engineering and customer out reach.


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Manufacturing sheet metal 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The Manufacturing world has been innovative but does not mean companies themselves upgrade quickly. Before manufacturing was a very difficult field using relay logic, meaning you would have a bunch of relays with inputs from the field and would fire these relays. This was very costly, now manufacturing uses PLC's (programmable logic controller) and PAC's (programmable automation controllers). PLCs revolutionized and made processes efficient and compact in one cabinet versus changing a whole control cabinet for different processes. PLCs moved the manufacturing business into industry 3.0 everything is hard wire connected and a step into the future, now we have entered Industry 4.0 utilizing a more digital world using ethernet protocols, AWS cloud, OPC UA, and much more IT and computer science technologies. We are now on the edge of AI being introduced which will take us to Industry 5.0, this will be smarter, faster and higher quality products being made in manufacturing. There are products using AI and mainly using this with quality control. 

Machina Labs is using their AI in real time to predict if a piece of material is being pushed to hard and damaging the mold they are printing. In a way this is quality control but it teaches the Machine Learning algorithm whether or not what they did was right and the algorithm will change how their process should be. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
From what I understand and google searches I do not think, in the united states someone else is using Machina Labs process to make sheet metal molds using AI and Robotics. There are other companys like GM, Ford and other car manufacturers. They use a whole line for stamping and have 1/3 of their facility dedicated to storage for these dies. 
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Huge impact they are cutting the cost for creating and making tooling, the Air Force chose Machina Labs because they can turn out tooling for cheaper and a lot faster than other traditional companies. They are the other process I know of that can process titanium at room temperature, most operations require massive amount of heat to complete this process.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
The metrics company use, is how do we make this efficient (fast), accurate to the mm (millimeter). Machina Labs used commercial robots (Fanuc, KUKA) where staff are trained easier, more support technically and readily available. They have eliminated cost of multiple machine centers and storage. Also the robot is universal to each job one robot infinite number of dies, molds and cast. While AI supports quality control and making the work more accurate. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
They are bring a new way of sheet metal manufacturing, offering services to hobbyist who need molds, all the way to GM and SpaceX. Machina Labs has found a way to include a broad range of customers, in multiple fields. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would say robotics and AI in the farm industry, whether the farm is indoor or outdoors robotics can be used to help cut cost on farmers and round the clock work.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would solve a future problem, we do not have as much farmers needed to keep food production moving forward. Having the ability of using AI to grow our food, aide in task the farmer deems remedial and has more import tasks. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Farming would need GPS, vision systems, portable power systems such as gas and solar, and AI with knowledge of farming. Also the mechanical workings would need to be robust and rugged to handle the dirt and moisture. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Most of the work is ran into lanes, tasks like spraying the field or harvesting. Using GPS monitoring and path sets controlled by ranchhands or farmers themselves. Vision systems to detect ripe fruit, and picking operations. Mobile power systems would be the hardest using gas and solar.
